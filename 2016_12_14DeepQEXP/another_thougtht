another thought

the main idea of deep Q is n times trying + Q table regression;

for original deep "discount factor" is useful. acted as a memory decay.
however in trading environment we more interested in maximum every signal
reward made by each action.

again, original Deep Q needs n times trying to complete its Q table. Then
"memorise" it(Q table) to make proper actions. In our instance Q table can simply
be generated base on different exist market strategy.

nots: there are two method of training a deep Q
1. out market strategy is given , let deep Q to learning in market strategy
this can be convert to RF + supervised Learning
2. let deep Q to distinguish different market's states
